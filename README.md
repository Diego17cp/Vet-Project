This is a project that was requested at the institute, it is a team work together with: [Julian](https://github.com/JulianB0315) and [Petuso](https://github.com/PetusoTwo). It is a small application for a veterinary that registers a query with the necessary data as a form, finally after storing everything in the database shows the receipt along with the amount to be paid, when accepting it will insert all the information in the respective tables.
